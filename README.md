# Remote Gist Bash Script Runner

Very similar to the [Remote Bash Script Runner](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-remote-script-runner) step, except that this one explicitly takes a main Gist URL, as opposed to a *raw* URL. This script scrapes the raw URL(s) of your Gist files from the content of the main URL, and then runs each of the scripts located at those URLs, in the order that the files appear on the Gist page (which is alphabetical by filename).

Note: it's uncommon for a Gist to contain multiple files, but this step _will_ find and run all of them.

You must provide a valid main Gist URL (*not* the raw URL).

For example, a main URL may look like this:

```
https://gist.github.com/jsauve/dec05365cdf201637b9e1545852abe25
```

...whereas a raw URL for one of the Gist files may look look this:

```
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jsauve/dec05365cdf201637b9e1545852abe25/raw/d7bdd21f5f1cddd5342f5804173967a4bff414fc/HelloWorld1.sh
```

You should be providing the *NON*-raw URL.


Can be run directly with the [bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise),
just `git clone` this repository, `cd` into it's folder in your Terminal/Command Line
and call `bitrise run test`.
